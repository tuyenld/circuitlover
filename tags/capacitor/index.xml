It is easy to forgot about the Lifetime of capacitors. This article is quick note how to estimate lifetime of electrolytic capacitor (elcap) provided by JIANGHAI 1. Other manufactures may have different ways to estimate lifetime of these capacitors. Please look up manufacturer application note for more detail.</description></item></channel></rss>
