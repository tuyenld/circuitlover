Phase-locked loop References 1. Fundamental terminologies # 1.1. Power # The instantaneous electrical power P delivered to a component is given by
$$ P(t)=I(t)\cdot V(t) $$ where
$P(t)$ is the instantaneous power, measured in watts (joules per second) $V(t)$ is the potential difference (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in volts $I(t)$ is the current through it, measured in amperes The average power is</description></item></channel></rss>
