When an electric field $E$ is applied, each carrier (i.e. electrons and holes) experiences a force $± q \times E$ and is accelerated. These velocities caused by the external electrical field $E$ are called drift velocities 1.
The current density $J$, or the current flow of electrons per unit volume, is given by the following:
$$ \begin{align*} J_n &amp;amp;= nqv_d \newline J_n &amp;amp;= nq\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{q\tau}{m^{2}}E \end{align*} $$</description></item><item><title>OrCAD simulation and PCB production</title><link>https://circuitlover.com/blog/orcad-simulation-and-pcb-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://circuitlover.com/blog/orcad-simulation-and-pcb-production/</guid><description>Orcard error list # ORCAP-1605 Two references have same name in different schematic.

Getting started # Switch utilization
$$ \frac{P_o}{P_T} = \frac{V_{o1,max} \times I_{o1,max}}{q \times V_T \times I_T} $$
Where
$V_{o1,max}, I_{o1,max}$ are the maximum rated output voltage and current. $V_T, I_T$ are the peak voltage rating and peak current rating of a switching device.</description></item><item><title>Lifetime calculation of Electrolytic Capacitors</title><link>https://circuitlover.com/blog/lifetime-calculation-of-electrolytic-capacitors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 09:19:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://circuitlover.com/blog/lifetime-calculation-of-electrolytic-capacitors/</guid><description>On the process of making new inverter/converter products, we are talking about what type of topology will be used, power losses and cost estimation. It is easy to forgot about the Lifetime of capacitors. This article is quick note how to estimate lifetime of electrolytic capacitor (elcap) provided by JIANGHAI 1.
