regional minimum: the bottom of the cone. catchment basin: the region from the bottom of the cone to watershed line watershed lines: the border of catchment basin The algorithm will find these points.
How it works # Find regional minimum From regional minimum, pull the water into catchment basin Keeping to pull water into catchment basin until catchment basin overlap.</description></item></channel></rss>
