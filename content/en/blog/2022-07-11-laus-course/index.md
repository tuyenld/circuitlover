There is a set of rules that you need to follow in order to keep you safe.

1. Make risk assessment.
2. Risk evaluation.
3. At least 2 people in the lab.
4. Cover electrical box.
5. HFI/HPFI protect you from electrical shock.
6. ESD of a floor: ~ M Ohm
7. Lithium has short circuit --> burn, fire.
   1. We need to have D_vincinity distance (near by area)
   2. D_living-zone distance
8. Tools: isolated, insulated.
9. Short circuit protection.
10. Need to test the "measurement tools" first.
11. Cover everything except what you are working on (in case the tools drop, and cause a short circuit)
12. Be careful working under dangerous environment (e.g., thunder storm)
13. Temperature of an electric arc is 20.000 degree whereas the temperature of the gas flame is 600 degree.
