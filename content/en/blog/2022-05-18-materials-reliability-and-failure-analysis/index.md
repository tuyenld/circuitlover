Kinetic thermal energy
$$
K_{kin} = \frac{m}{2}v_{th}^2 = \frac{3}{2}kT
$$

When an electric field $E$ is applied, each carrier (i.e. electrons and holes) experiences a force $Â± q \times E$ and is accelerated. These velocities caused by the external electrical field $E$ are called **drift velocities**.

The current density $J$, or the current flow of electrons per unit volume, is given by the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
J_n &= nqv_d \newline
J_n &= nq\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{q\tau}{m^{2}}E
\end{align*}
$$

Electron mobility $\mu_n$ is the ratio of drift velocity to the electric field strength.

$$
\mu_n = \dfrac{\nu_d}{E} = \dfrac{q \tau}{m^*}
$$
